Completed:
Clear Creature and GameStage
Controls fix (add proper mouse support for zoom)
Controls fix (movement through the screen)

Creature Actor position and rotation fix
GameStage.java implements ContactListener (controls) (not implements but sets up)
remove UserData, UserDataType and move all references to GameActors ( IBodyUserData now represents this )

    set Angular and Linear velocities separately


Reimplement Obstacle
InputMultiplexer

fixed   wrong body || weapon rotation on creation
fixed   freaking camera viewport
fixed   merge Fighter body and weapon body (createFixture) (nothing, this has no sense)
fixed   camera movement
fixed   world timestep || creature speed (+angular) so it would not miss waypoints
fixed   random Fighter rotation
